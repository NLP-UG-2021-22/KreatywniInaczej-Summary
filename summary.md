# *CHAPTER 7: COMBINING WORDS*
This chapter discusses [syntactic categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_category). It provides the readers with the knowledge of how to categorize words into nouns, verbs, and adjectives, identify the head in a compound, and categorize function words into closed-class categories.

## 7.1	*Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives: Open Class Categories*
At first, the category of **nouns** is discussed. Anderson remarks upon the behaviour of nouns which allows one to categorize them as such. The author reflects upon what inflectional morphemes the word takes. She observes that although most English nouns have a singular and a plural form, there is a subcategory called mass nouns, nouns referring to uncountable entities.
As mentioned by the author, in her book she decides to group **pronouns** into the category of nouns, noting that they’re a unique case.
Next, she gives attention to **verbs**:
> Morphologically, verbs have a past tense form and a progressive form. For a few verbs, the past tense form is spelled or pronounced the same as the bare form (Anderson 2018: 211).

Lastly, she introduces **adjectives** and lists the positions in which they can appear:
-	between the word *the* and a noun
-	after any of the forms of the verb *be*
-	after the words *very* or *more*

She remarks that some adjectives have comparative and superlative forms as the word *red* (*redder* – *reddest*) has.
She gives some consideration to **adverbs**, whose behaviour is much more challenging to observe. They do not have comparative and superlative forms but they can be intensified with *very* and *more*. She notices that although many adverbs can be formed by adding suffix *-ly* to an adjective, many adverbs cannot be derived this way and many words ending in *-ly* are not adverbs. She sums up by noticing that adverbs can precede or follow verbs and they can precede adjectives or other adverbs.

The chapter is concluded with the introduction of the term **open-class categories**. Nouns, verbs, and adjectives can be said to represent this category since:
> […] when new words get added to the language, they are almost always in one of these three categories – the categories are open to new members. These categories are sometimes also called **lexical categories** or **content words** because these categories are the ones that do most of the lexical semantic work in a sentence: they convey most of the meaning of a sentence (Anderson 2018: 211).

## *7.2  Compound Words*
One of the most productive ways to create new words is said to be **compounding** where the new word is produced by joining two free morphemes. You can see the video on compound words [here](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/chapter/7-3-compound-words/#pb-interactive-content). 

Another productive process is called **affixation**. During this process, a bound morpheme is affixed to a base. The meaning can be deduced from the base of a word.

Compounding can be exemplified by means of the word *greenhouse*, created by combining two free morphemes. Its meaning is different from the meaning of the phrase *a green house*. The word refers to the building where plants are grown, while the phrase refers to the colour of the building.

There is only one part of a compound that has a special role. Even if both parts of a compound contribute to the meaning, it is the head of a compound that determines its category. English is a **head-final** language because in this language the second part of the compound determines the category of the compound. Some languages are **head-initial**, with the head as the first element in a compound.

[Endocentric compounds](http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Endocentric_compound) have a head that establishes the meaning and the category of the compound. [Exocentric compounds](https://www.thoughtco.com/exocentric-compound-words-1690583) do not have a base or root that establishes the meaning of the word. 

## 7.3 *Closed Class Categories (Function Words)*
In the opposition to open-class categories stand **closed-classed categories** to which the language does not usually add new words. Words that belong to closed-class categories are called **function words**. These are:
- **determiners** which most often appear before nouns:
    - **articles** (*<ins>a</ins> student*, *<ins>an</ins>  orange*, *<ins>the</ins>  snake*)
    - **demonstratives** (*<ins>those</ins> students*, *<ins>these</ins> oranges*, *<ins>that</ins> snake*, *<ins>this</ins> idea*)
    - **quantifiers** and **numerals** (*<ins>many</ins> students*, *<ins>twelve</ins> oranges*, *<ins>most</ins> snakes*, *<ins>several</ins> ideas*)
    - **possessive pronouns** (*<ins>my</ins> sister*, *<ins>your</ins> idea*)
- **prepositions** which usually appear with a noun phrase immediately following them (<ins>on</ins> the table, <ins>in</ins> the basket)
- **conjunctions** join two phrases that belong to the same category (*oranges <ins>and</ins> lemons*, *soup <ins>or</ins> salad*, *small <ins>but</ins> mighty*)
- **complementizers** introduce a clause which is a sentence embedded within a larger sentence (*Sam told us <ins>that</ins> she loved baseball*; *She decided to go running <ins>although</ins> a storm was forecast*).

## 7.4 *Auxiliaries*
**Auxiliaries** provide grammatical information about a verb’s tense or aspect, or other elements of meaning. There are nine **modal auxiliaries**:
1. can
2. could
3. shall
4. should
5. will
6. would
7. may
8. might
9. must

The verbs *have*, *be*, and *do* can behave like auxiliaries too. They can be inflected, so even when they are auxiliaries, they are **non-modal**. 
The following sentences illustrate the use of non-modal auxiliaries:
-	Arlene <ins>is</ins> writing a novel. 
-	Beulah <ins>has</ins> arrived in Saskatoon. 
-	Doris <ins>did</ins> not buy any vegetables.

If there’s no other verb in the clause, *have*, *be*, or *do* is probably the main verb.

## 7.5	*Neurolinguistics: Syntactic Category Differences in the Brain*
In the final section of the chapter neurolinguistic evidence is provided to prove that "syntactic categories exist not just in language, but also in the brain" (Anderson 2018: 228).

As the first example a study of brain activity measured with [**fMRI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging) is described. A list of 3 words from the same syntactic category was shown to the subjects. They were then asked whether the last word was related to the preceding two. The results indicated that "there were several areas of the brain that showed greater blood flow for verbs than for nouns" (Anderson 2018: 226). The greater blood flow is indicatory of greater the oxygen demand, and greater brain activity. This proves that the division of words into categories is reflected in brain activity. 


Another piece of evidence for it is also provided in this subchapter: a study of people suffering from two different types of aphasia. They were given three tasks: picture naming, action description, and story narration. Later, the collection of subjects' speech from these tasks was compared to the control group. The Nouns to Verb ratio indicated dissociation in subjects from test groups. In the control group the ratio was close to 1. In subjects with [**agrammatic aphasia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrammatism), for whom verbs are difficult to produce, the ratio was close to 2. Conversely, in the case of people with [**anomic aphasia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomic_aphasia) (having difficulty with nouns) the ratio was less than 1. This shows that different brain injuries cause impairment of different syntactic categories. 

# *CHAPTER 11: INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES*

## 11.1	*Indigenous Languages and the Legacy of Residential Schools*

In this section the history and future of indigenous languages of Canada is described. Out of estimated two hundred only 64 of these languages still survive, some having a mere dozen of speakers.  

The author argues that apart from economic and cultural pressure, there were other (less obvious) factors that contributed very strongly to the displacement of aboriginal languages by English. First, there were wars, epidemics, and famine caused by the European settlers. Aboriginal Canadians were forced into reserves and their children taken away to foster homes and residential schools. Here the author quotes  Sir John A Macdonald, Canada’s first prime minister:

> When the school is on the reserve the child lives with its parents, who are savages; he is surrounded by savages, and though he may learn to read and write, his habits, and training and mode of thought are Indian. He is simply a savage who can read and write [...] These residential schools were created for the purpose of separating Aboriginal children from their families, in order to minimize and weaken family ties and cultural linkages, and to indoctrinate children into a new culture—the culture of the legally dominant Euro-Christian Canadian society.

Then, TRC’s appeal to the federal government to enact an Aboriginal Languages Act are recounted. Some of the points made in the Call to Action are listed. These are mostly related to language preservation, revitalization and teaching.

The section is concluded with the description of the efforts made by linguists to preserve the indigenous languages. Their work involved recording and transcribing speech, creating phonological, morphological and syntactic analysis, as well as developing writing systems when needed. 

## 11.2	*Preserving Mohawk*

This part is devoted to [an interview](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/chapter/11-2/) with David Kanatawakhon-Maracle, a Mohawk teacher, who expresses his views on language teaching and the preservation of Aboriginal languages. He claims that the best way to save a language from extinction is taking action i.e. learning said language and using it actively, not only at home, but also in public.

As a matter of fact, the notion of speaking native languages mainly at home is heavily criticized by Kanatawakhon-Maracle. This point of view is believed to originate from the times of colonialism, when speaking Indigenous languages in public was considered disgraceful. The speaker maintains that if this situation continues, it may result in a gradual but __inevitable__ disappearance of the language.

## 11.3	*Learning Mohawk*

The speaker then continues to [share his experiences](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/chapter/learning-mohawk/) of learning Mohawk. He reminisces about spending time with older people, who used to be the main source of his knowledge about the language. A comparison between _the old_ and _the young_ is made - the former tend to be more laid-back and carefree, which makes them more enjoyable to be around.

However, more effort must be put into gaining the __trust__ of the older people. They are unwilling to share the knowledge they possess with strangers, therefore, __patience__ is needed if one wishes to acquire it. This may be a serious obstacle when attempting to preserve the language, because traditions must be passed on to the next generations to prevent them from being abandoned.

In addition, Kanatawakhon-Maracle presents the change in the behaviour of people depending on the language they are speaking at the moment. He brings up an example of his uncle, who used to complain nonstop when speaking English, but as soon as they started speaking Mohawk, he seemed to __light up__ and __radiate positive energy__ all around.

At the end, the speaker communicates his strong conviction that __grammar practice is superior to learning vocabulary__. The main rationale behind this theory is that the familiarity with the lexicon of a language does not guarantee the ability to communicate. In other words, students who do not know the grammar of a certain language, have no idea how to utilise the words and phrases they have learnt.

## 11.4 *Mohawk Culture and Language*

In this section, the speaker focuses on the elements of Mohawk language that __embody its cultural distinctiveness__. As he states, students should be familiarised not only with Mohawk words and expressions, but also their origin and usage, which may differ from English.

An example provided by the speaker is the word _nyaweh_, which has the meaning similar to "thank you", however, the context in which it should be used differs from English. It is heavily overused by English speakers, so its true meaning is lost. Mohawk speakers, on the other hand, reserve _nyaweh_ for special occasions and use it to express their gratitude to the Creator.

Despite traditions, young speakers can still be heard using _nyaweh_ in the same way as 'thank you'. This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that language gradually changes over time. Kanatawakhon-Maracle objects to this situation. He states that __certain elements of the language must remain the same__, otherwise it will lose its uniqueness.

Another example of a Mohawk language's characteristic is __the lack of a negative future__. Instead of saying "it will not snow", a Mohawk speaker would use a construction with the meaning more similar to "there's a possibility that it won't snow".

The last feature that differentiates Mohawk from English mentioned by the speaker is __free word order__. However, the position of a word in a sentence affects the way it is stressed. The emphasis may be put on different constituents, as in the following example:
* “The BOY is walking on the road?” “raksá:’a ire ohaháke“.
* “The boy is WALKING on the road”? “ire raksá:’a ohaháke“.
* “The boy is walking on the ROAD”? “ohaháke ire raksá:’a“.

Kanatawakhon-Maracle underlines the fact that cultural changes are reflected in the language. For instance, the word _oháhsera_ used to originally refer to a bone, but a [semantic change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change) occurred gradually. A similar shape prompted people to use _oháhsera_ to refer to candles, then lamps and nowadays it is used to refer to any object that produces artificial light.

# *CHAPTER 7: COMBINING WORDS*
This chapter discusses [syntactic categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_category). It provides the readers with the knowledge of how to categorize words into nouns, verbs, and adjectives, identify the head in a compound, and categorize function words into closed-class categories.

## 7.1	*Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives: Open Class Categories*
At first, the category of **nouns** is discussed. Anderson remarks upon the behaviour of nouns which allows one to categorize them as such. The author reflects upon what inflectional morphemes the word takes. She observes that although most English nouns have a singular and a plural form, there is a subcategory called mass nouns, nouns referring to uncountable entities.
As mentioned by the author, in her book she decides to group **pronouns** into the category of nouns, noting that they’re a unique case.
Next, she gives attention to **verbs**:
> Morphologically, verbs have a past tense form and a progressive form. For a few verbs, the past tense form is spelled or pronounced the same as the bare form (Anderson 2018: 211).

Lastly, she introduces **adjectives** and lists the positions in which they can appear:
-	between the word *the* and a noun
-	after any of the forms of the verb *be*
-	after the words *very* or *more*

She remarks that some adjectives have comparative and superlative forms as the word *red* (*redder* – *reddest*) has.
She gives some consideration to **adverbs**, whose behaviour is much more challenging to observe. They do not have comparative and superlative forms but they can be intensified with *very* and *more*. She notices that although many adverbs can be formed by adding suffix *-ly* to an adjective, many adverbs cannot be derived this way and many words ending in *-ly* are not adverbs. She sums up by noticing that adverbs can precede or follow verbs and they can precede adjectives or other adverbs.

The chapter is concluded with the introduction of the term **open-class categories**. Nouns, verbs, and adjectives can be said to represent this category since:
> […] when new words get added to the language, they are almost always in one of these three categories – the categories are open to new members. These categories are sometimes also called **lexical categories** or **content words** because these categories are the ones that do most of the lexical semantic work in a sentence: they convey most of the meaning of a sentence (Anderson 2018: 211).

## *7.2  Compound Words*
One of the most productive ways to create new words is said to be **compounding** where the new word is produced by joining two free morphemes. You can see the video on compound words [here] (https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/chapter/7-3-compound-words/#pb-interactive-content). 

Another productive process is called **affixation**. During this process, a bound morpheme is affixed to a base. The meaning can be deduced from the base of a word.

Compounding can be exemplified by means of the word *greenhouse*, created by combining two free morphemes. Its meaning is different from the meaning of the phrase *a green house*. The word refers to the building where plants are grown, while the phrase refers to the colour of the building.

There is only one part of a compound that has a special role. Even if both parts of a compound contribute to the meaning, it is the head of a compound that determines its category. English is a **head-final** language because in this language the second part of the compound determines the category of the compound. Some languages are **head-initial**, with the head as the first element in a compound.

[Endocentric compounds](http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Endocentric_compound) have a head that establishes the meaning and the category of the compound. [Exocentric compounds](https://www.thoughtco.com/exocentric-compound-words-1690583) do not have a base or root that establishes the meaning of the word. 

## 7.3 *Closed Class Categories (Function Words)*
In the opposition to open-class categories stand **closed-classed categories** to which the language does not usually add new words. Words that belong to closed-class categories are called **function words**. These are:
- **determiners** which most often appear before nouns:
    - **articles** (*<ins>a</ins> student*, *<ins>an</ins>  orange*, *<ins>the</ins>  snake*)
    - **demonstratives** (*<ins>those</ins> students*, *<ins>these</ins> oranges*, *<ins>that</ins> snake*, *<ins>this</ins> idea*)
    - **quantifiers** and **numerals** (*<ins>many</ins> students*, *<ins>twelve</ins> oranges*, *<ins>most</ins> snakes*, *<ins>several</ins> ideas*)
    - **possessive pronouns** (*<ins>my</ins> sister*, *<ins>your</ins> idea*)
- **prepositions** which usually appear with a noun phrase immediately following them (<ins>on</ins> the table, <ins>in</ins> the basket)
- **conjunctions** join two phrases that belong to the same category (*oranges <ins>and</ins> lemons*, *soup <ins>or</ins> salad*, *small <ins>but</ins> mighty*)
- **complementizers** introduce a clause which is a sentence embedded within a larger sentence (*Sam told us <ins>that</ins> she loved baseball*; *She decided to go running <ins>although</ins> a storm was forecast*).

## 7.4 *Auxiliaries*
**Auxiliaries** provide grammatical information about a verb’s tense or aspect, or other elements of meaning. There are nine **modal auxiliaries**:
1.  can
2. could
3. shall
4. should
5. will
6. would
7. may
8. might
9. must

The verbs *have*, *be*, and *do* can behave like auxiliaries too. They can be inflected, so even when they are auxiliaries, they are **non-modal**. 
The following sentences illustrate the use of non-modal auxiliaries:
-	Arlene <ins>is</ins> writing a novel. 
-	Beulah <ins>has</ins> arrived in Saskatoon. 
-	Doris <ins>did</ins> not buy any vegetables.

If there’s no other verb in the clause, *have*, *be*, or *do* is probably the main verb.

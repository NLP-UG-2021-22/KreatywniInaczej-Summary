# *CHAPTER 7: COMBINING WORDS*
This chapter discusses [syntactic categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_category). It provides the readers with the knowledge of how to categorize words into nouns, verbs, and adjectives, identify the head in a compound, and categorize function words into closed-class categories.

## 7.1	*Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives: Open Class Categories*
At first, the category of **nouns** is discussed. Anderson remarks upon the behaviour of nouns which allows one to categorize them as such. The author reflects upon what inflectional morphemes the word takes. She observes that although most English nouns have a singular and a plural form, there is a subcategory called mass nouns, nouns referring to uncountable entities.
As mentioned by the author, in her book she decides to group **pronouns** into the category of nouns, noting that they’re a unique case.
Next, she gives attention to **verbs**:
> Morphologically, verbs have a past tense form and a progressive form. For a few verbs, the past tense form is spelled or pronounced the same as the bare form (Anderson 2018: 211).

Lastly, she introduces **adjectives** and lists the positions in which they can appear:
-	between the word *the* and a noun
-	after any of the forms of the verb *be*
-	after the words *very* or *more*

She remarks that some adjectives have comparative and superlative forms as the word *red* (*redder* – *reddest*) has.
She gives some consideration to **adverbs**, whose behaviour is much more challenging to observe. They do not have comparative and superlative forms but they can be intensified with *very* and *more*. She notices that although many adverbs can be formed by adding suffix *-ly* to an adjective, many adverbs cannot be derived this way and many words ending in *-ly* are not adverbs. She sums up by noticing that adverbs can precede or follow verbs and they can precede adjectives or other adverbs.

The chapter is concluded with the introduction of the term **open-class categories**. Nouns, verbs, and adjectives can be said to represent this category since:
> […] when new words get added to the language, they are almost always in one of these three categories – the categories are open to new members. These categories are sometimes also called **lexical categories** or **content words** because these categories are the ones that do most of the lexical semantic work in a sentence: they convey most of the meaning of a sentence (Anderson 2018: 211).
